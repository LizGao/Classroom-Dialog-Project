# Classroom-Dialogue-Project


> [!NOTE]
> 这是最外层的README file，需要大家一起完成，特别是Nunu。在这里我们要介绍整个项目以及每个文件夹的内容，以防迷路。

## 第一次用GitHub的朋友，什么是README？

你现在读到的东西就是README，README的内容会自动出现在文件夹的下面，通常作为你想对刚点进这个文件夹的人说的话，可以写你想写的一切，介绍、打招呼、或者你想让看的人快滚出去 :cursing_face: 也不是不可以？？

## 第一次用GitHub的朋友，怎么编辑README.md？

* 点击README.md
* 点这个
   ![Team-Roles](Images/How-to-Edit-README.png)
* [如何编辑.md格式的文件？](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
  总而言之，README的内容不像word文件一样可以直接编辑，而是要通过编辑.md文件来改变README的内容。GitHub网页会根据.md文件的内容渲染显示在首页的README。
* When you are editing: 可以点Preview实时查看渲染结果。
* When you are done editing: 在Preview中确认无误后，看到右上角点绿色 **"Commit changes..."** 了么？点它。下面的二选一选项不用管。如果你想要记录一下这一次编辑你修改了什么，做了什么，就在框框里写一下。如果不手动写也没关系，GitHub会根据你编辑的文件自动生成一个默认的commit message。
* After commit: 恭喜你，刚刚你修改的内容已经被保存下来了 :japanese_ogre:

## Introduction:

* **Background:**
  
  This project is the design product of Qingyi's PhD research project on classroom dialogue and science subjects in secondary education. Her research uses design-based research (DBR) method. She expects the product will undergo two to three iterations according to her collaboration with first-line school teachers. The product aims to facilitate student-student and student-teacher **classroom dialogue**, as well as students' **intrinsic motivation** to engage with the learning materials. Her research aims focus on (i) finding supports and challenges taht science teachers in China face when trying to conduct high-quality classroom dialogue; (ii) investigating the design components in which secondary school students find intrinsically motivating for them to engage further in learning and classroom dialogues. She may also look at (iii) whether neurodiverse students benefit more from the design product.

   产品目的：促进学生dialogu engagement + motivation



## Design:

* **Introduction**

  Our serious game product will have two modes, including (1) **solving** fantasised teaching content-related **problems** by role-playing in a group setting and (2) **previewing** and **reviewing** the teaching contents by having dialogues with the characters through *independent* choice making and feedback receiving. We decided to use these two modes because we wanted to provide a platform which invites students, especially those who are quiet, into classroom dialogues, so that (a) they learn implicitly, through simulation, how to use dialogues to communicate science knowledge; (b) they can be intrinsically motivated to learn more sciences; (c) their multimodal interaction with other students, teachers and teaching materials may be observed effectively; (d) their cognitive processes may be visualised automatically to their teachers to guide lesson preparation. The teaching content-related aims are **to be determined** with first-line secondary school teachers.
