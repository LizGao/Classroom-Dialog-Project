/**
 * Kernel of the entire Java program. Manages server instance(s).
 * Has three major jobs:
 *      1. Shell interface of the server, allows manual sudo operations on files
 *         and server instance(s).
 *      2. Handles file IO and file version control and synchronization.
 *      3. Checks life stage of service server, manages server lifecycle.
 *
 * ? What is ServerKernel
 *      The server kernel is a robust, well-debugged layer of the program that
 *      manages the service layer and directly interacts with OS and files.
 *      We will have to make sure that the kernel layer NEVER crashes.
