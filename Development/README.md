# Implementation Note:

## Flutter:

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is the cross-platform development tool that we're using. Flutter itself is just an open-source [**SDK**](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/sdk/) developed by Google. To write your code, you will need an [**IDE**](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide) like [_VSCode_](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [_IntelliJ_](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). 

How do you develop with Flutter in IDE that is not designed for it? Well, check out the following links. You'll get an answer while you install Flutter.

The language Flutter uses is called **Dart**.
